# Reinforcement Trading Bot and Time Series Analysis


## Overview

The "Reinforcement Trading Bot and Time Series Analysis" project leverages the Gym environment, a toolkit designed for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The project combines reinforcement learning techniques with time series analysis to create a trading bot capable of making informed decisions in the market.

## Features

- **ARIMA Time Series Analysis:**
  - Implemented the ARIMA model for time series analysis of market data.
  - Generated predictions for market trends to assist in decision-making.

- **Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot:**
  - Developed a trading bot using reinforcement learning techniques.
  - Utilized the Gym environment to simulate market interactions and agent training.

- **Integration of MACD Algorithm:**
  - Integrated the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) trading algorithm.
  - Identified potential buying and selling points based on price momentum and trends.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
  - Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Addressed missing values, outliers, and normalization to enhance data quality.
